# `multistage Dockerfile` tutorial
in this tutorial we are gonna work on our `multistage Dockerfile` skills.  
We will create a dockerfile that runs a pipeline â€” covering build, lint, test, and finally deployment.
This will allow us to create a Container pipeline instead of building custom Jobs for every
project in [`JENKINS`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/) or [`CircleCI`](https://circleci.com/product/) for that matter.
This will also allow us to seamlessly create container pipeline and reuse it with any CI/CD framework.
